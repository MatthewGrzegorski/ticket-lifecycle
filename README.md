<h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Ticket Lifecycle</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Ticket Intake</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Submission Channels:</strong> Tickets can be submitted via email, web forms, or API integrations. Ensure that submissions capture key details such as contact information, a description of the issue, and any relevant attachments.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Capture:</strong> Validate that mandatory fields are filled to prevent incomplete submissions. This initial information is crucial for proper ticket management.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acknowledgment & Logging</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Immediate Acknowledgment:</strong> Automatically send a confirmation email or notification to the customer, including a unique ticket ID and a summary of the submitted details.</li>
      <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Record the ticket in the osTicket system with a timestamp and an initial status to ensure traceability and accountability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Verification & Initial Categorization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Review Details:</strong> Verify that all submitted information is accurate and complete. If needed, contact the customer for any clarifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Issue Categorization:</strong> Classify the ticket based on type (e.g., technical, billing, general inquiry) and determine whether it correlates with any existing issues by comparing it with previous tickets.</li>
      <li><strong>Severity Assessment:</strong> Evaluate the impact of the issue to assign an appropriate priority level (e.g., low, medium, high, or critical).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assignment & Communication</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ticket Assignment:</strong> Route the ticket to the most suitable support agent or team based on expertise and current workload.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal Notes:</strong> Document initial assessments and any immediate actions in the ticket to provide context for the assigned agent.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Communication:</strong> Inform the customer about the ticket assignment, outline expected response times, and explain the next steps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Investigation & Troubleshooting</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Detailed Investigation:</strong> The assigned agent gathers additional details, reviews logs, and attempts to replicate the issue if feasible.</li>
      <li><strong>Progress Updates:</strong> Regularly update the ticket with troubleshooting steps, findings, and any interim solutions, ensuring that both internal teams and the customer stay informed.</li>
      <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> If the issue requires more specialized expertise, escalate it to a higher-tier support team while keeping all stakeholders informed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resolution & Verification</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Implementing the Solution:</strong> Apply the appropriate fix or workaround to resolve the issue.</li>
      <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Thoroughly test the solution to ensure the issue is fully resolved and that no residual problems remain.</li>
      <li><strong>Customer Confirmation:</strong> Reach out to the customer to confirm that the issue has been satisfactorily resolved, making adjustments if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ticket Closure & Documentation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Closing the Ticket:</strong> Once resolution is confirmed, update the ticket status to “closed” and archive all related information within the system.</li>
      <li><strong>Comprehensive Documentation:</strong> Record every step taken, including communications, troubleshooting steps, and the final resolution. This documentation is vital for future reference and for enhancing the support process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Post-Resolution Follow-Up & Quality Review</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Optionally, contact the customer after a set period to ensure the issue hasn’t recurred and to gather feedback on their support experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Regularly review closed tickets to identify trends, update the knowledge base, and refine the overall ticket handling process for continuous improvement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
